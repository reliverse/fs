# @reliverse/fs: File System Utilities

[@reliverse/fs](https://npmjs.com/package/@reliverse/fs) is a utility library that wraps the [Node.js native `fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module and [fs-extra](https://npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) package, providing enhanced file system functionalities. This package is part of the broader `@reliverse/addons` ecosystem.

**Note:** This project currently focuses on adding custom utilities (which use `fs-extra` and `pathe`), rather than re-exporting or modifying existing functionality from `fs` or `fs-extra`.

For more detailed usage instructions, API documentation, and examples, please visit the [Reliverse Docs](https://reliverse.org) website. If you find that the page for this library is missing, please notify us or consider contributing to add it.

## Installation

To install this package, run:

```bash
pnpm add @reliverse/fs@latest
```

or with Bun:

```bash
bun add @reliverse/fs@latest
```

## How to Use This Library

To use `@reliverse/fs`, ensure that your project is set up as an ES module by including `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file. Since this package is structured as an ES module, you'll need to use `import` statements instead of `require`.

The library primarily relies on the async versions of `fs` functions, so you need to add the `await` keyword before the utils from our library.

Here's an example of how to import and use a function from this package:

```ts
import { fileExists } from "@reliverse/fs";

const someFile = "path/to/file.ts";

export async function checkFile() {
  await fileExists(someFile);
}
```

Please refer to the source files located in the [`src` folder](https://github.com/reliverse/fs/blob/main/src) to learn about the currently implemented functions.

This package adopts the ES module format, with files compiled to `dist/.js` (formerly known as `dist/.mjs`). This approach aligns with the Node.js team's recent recommendations, encouraging the JavaScript/TypeScript community to transition to the ES module standard. If your project still requires CommonJS (CJS) support, you may fork this repository and modify the build process to generate `dist/.cjs` files.
